# Assignments for Image Processing

## Assignment 1
- **Prework**: Install Jupyter Notebook in Miniconda, set up `ece352_env` with pip libraries, create first notebook, and explore cells/saving/loading via online manual.
- **ToDo**:
  - Process "scarlett.jpg" (or any image) with transform \( s = T(z) = \log_2(z) \), plot \( s \) vs. \( z \), normalize with \( s_{scale} = \frac{L}{\log_2(1+L)} \) (\( L = 255 \)), and replot.
  - Apply sigmoid function, plot \( s \) vs. \( z \).
  - Show original and processed images as subplots for both cases.

## Assignment 2
- **ToDo**:
  - Create `image_conv` function for convolution of image \( f \) and filter \( w \).
  - Use 5x5 \( f \) with random integers [0,9] and 3x3 filter \( [[0.125, 0.25, 0], [0.125, 0.5, 0], [0, 0, 0]] \).
  - Create `padding` function to zero-pad \( f \) from NxN to (N+2)x(N+2).
  - Convolve padded \( f \) with flipped \( w \) (both dimensions).
  - Convolve "gradient_noise.png" with 3x3 averaging filter (all values \( \frac{1}{9} \)) using above functions.

## Assignment 3
- **ToDo**:
  - Load color images: "mountain.jpg", "pencils.png", "pencils2.png".
  - Create `euclidean_distance` function for two inputs (p, q), returning float distance.
  - Create `color_histogram` function for color images, using per-channel histograms, concatenating results, and normalizing by sum (inputs: image, bins).
  - Create `min_max_normalization` function to scale array \( f \) to [0,1].
  - Create `luminance` function for 3-channel image, computing \( 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B \), normalizing with `min_max_normalization`, and scaling to [0,255].
  - Tasks:
    - Compute `color_histogram` (bins=16) and `euclidean_distance` for pairs (1-2, 1-3, 2-3).
    - Repeat with luminance images, compute histograms and distances (bins=16), compare results in code comments.
    - Visualize three color images and their luminance versions.
    
# Project Overview

## Image Editing and Meme Creation Tool
- **Description**: A Python-based tool for editing images and generating memes. Features interactive filter application (e.g., blur, sharpen, grayscale) and meme overlays on detected facial features (face, eyes, mouth, etc.) using OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascades. Supports saving, loading, and managing images/memes with a simple command-line interface.
- **Purpose**: Designed for quick image manipulation and humorous meme creation with customizable filters and text.
- **Tech**: Built with Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL.
